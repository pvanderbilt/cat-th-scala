# cat-theory-scala

Some category theory coded in Scala.

For the
[SFTTLP meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Types-Theorems-and-Programming-Languages)
track (which started July 2020) on  *Computational Category Theory* by Rydeheard and Burstall.

Inspired by and drawing code from Young-il C's
[Scala Categories](https://gitlab.com/youngil/scala-categories)
implementation,
but using traits with type members for objects and arrows.
